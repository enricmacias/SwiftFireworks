## Requirements

- iOS 8.0

## In detail

SwiftFireworks is a light library that let's you show animated fireworks using CoreAnimation.
You only need to specify which UIView you want to show the firework and the position of this one.
The library provides two different methods to show them:

```ruby
// Shows only one firework at a time.
func showFirework(inView view:UIView, andPosition position:CGPoint, radius:CGFloat? = nil, sparkLength:CGFloat? = nil, sparkThickness:CGFloat? = nil, sparkSeparation:CGFloat? = nil, color:UIColor? = nil)
```

```ruby
// Shows a set of fireworks
func showFireworkSet(inView view:UIView, andPosition position:CGPoint, numberOfFireworks num:UInt? = nil) 
```

## Usage

1. Import SwiftFireworks library into the file you want to show the fireworks
```ruby
import SwiftFireworks
```

2. Shoot a firework to the UIView you want
```ruby
SwiftFireworks.sharedInstance.showFirework(inView: view,ã€€andPosition: CGPoint(x: posX, y: posY))
```

## Installation
